# Multi-period Investment Calculator
Help estimate the value of investment accounts with contributions and compound interest over a period of time or multiple periods.

#### i.e.
What would be the value of my investments if I contributed $2,500 monthly with an annual return of 8% over 5 years? Further, what would it be if I changed my contributions from $2,500/mo. to $4,000/mo. for an additional 7 years with an annual return 6%?
